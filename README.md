# NETFLIX CLONE WEBSITE USING HTML & CSS
This is a web development project that gives an insight on how to develop a clone website of an existing website. Here in this project a clone of Netflix is built using HTML and CSS. 
## Short explanation of the code
The code represents an HTML webpage layout along with CSS for Netflix India (clone). It features a navigation bar with language options and a sign-in button. The main content includes sections promoting Netflix features like watching on TV, downloading shows for offline viewing, and streaming on various devices. Each section is accompanied by descriptive text and relevant images or videos. A Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) section addresses common queries. The footer contains links for Investor Relations, Jobs, and other resources. CSS styling is applied through an external stylesheet ("style1.css") to maintain consistency and enhance visual appeal across the page.
## Final result
Since for opening an html doc file there are various local computer requirements, such as the path of the images and videos used from my local storage,etc. I present here a composite solution of viewing the final output without the need of hustling with the primary requirements.
